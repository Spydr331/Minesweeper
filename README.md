# Minesweeper
This is a web implementation of the "popular" game Minesweeper. You can control how many mines there are and how large the board is.  

Currently there are controls only for mousedown. So left click will activate a block and right click will flag it.  There is a flag counter on the bottom and if you righ click a flag you get the question mark.
